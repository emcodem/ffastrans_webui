The certificate provided in this directory serves as an example, so please DO NOT use it in production.
You'll need to generate your own and there are essentially two ways of doing it: self signed certificates or CA Signed certificates.
For both options, you'll need OpenSSL which you can download from https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries

### Self signed certificates ###
Those kind of certificates will be signed by yourself, which means that you'll both create and sign the certificate yourself.
Certificates are generally used to validate the authenticity of a host, which means that if you self-sign this certificate,
any client accessing the webinterface will need to have it saved as trusted, otherwise the browser will report a big red warning.
If you're the administrator of a domain and you're planning to use the webinterface on an internal network only, 
then you can easily use this option and deploy the cert via Group Policy to all machines registered to the domain.
If not, then go to option 2, CA Signed Certificates down below.

To generate a self signed certificate, first open cmd (run as administrator).
Then cd to wherever you installed OpenSSL, in my case:

cd \Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin

Generate a private key that you will never ever share with anyone else.
This will be generated based on a password you'll choose (memorize the password and store it safely) using AES256:

openssl genrsa -aes256 -out "C:\Temp\key.pem" 2048

(when prompted to choose a password, type it and confirm it)

Once you have the key.pem, you need to edit the default example configuration file, namely myserver.cnf.
Edit it with notepad and under "ORGNAME" insert the name of your company (or your own name), then save it.

At this point you're almost done, all you need is to generate the certificate.
To do that, put the edited myserver.cnf in C:\Temp\, then go back to the same cmd as before and type:

openssl req -config "C:\Temp\myserver.cnf" -key "C:\Temp\key.pem" -new -x509 -days 7300 -sha256 -out "C:\Temp\cert.pem"

you're all done, you can now just collect the key.pem, cert.pem and myserver.cnf, 
put them in the cert folder of the webinterface by replacing the example one 
and after that you can easily go settings, fill the password field with the password you picked during the creation of the key.pem
and enable the HTTPS mode.


### Self signed certificates ###
Those kind of certificates will be released by a CA Authority, which means that they will be trusted by all modern OS and computers on the web.
CA Authorities are trustworthy organizations which are recognized across the world and are stored in the Trusted Root by various OS.
To do this, we will need to create a CSR (Certificate Signing Request) in which we will ask the Certificate Authority to trust us.
First things first, let's fire up OpenSSL.
Open cmd (run as administrator) and cd to wherever you installed OpenSSL, in my case:

cd \Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin

Generate a private key that you will never ever share with anyone else.
This will be generated based on a password you'll choose (memorize the password and store it safely) using AES256:

openssl genrsa -aes256 -out "C:\Temp\key.pem" 2048

(when prompted to choose a password, type it and confirm it)

Once you have the key.pem, you need to generate a CSR (Certificate Signing Request).
The CA (Certificate Authority) will need a few info from you:

1) Country Name (2 letter code)
2) State or Province Name (full)
3) Locality Name (eg, city)
4) Organization Name (eg, company)
5) Organizational Unit Name (eg, section)
6) Common Name (eg, your name)
7) Email Address (your email)
8) A challenge password (a safe password that you can share with the CA, NOT the one you used to generate the key!)
9) An optional company name

As soon as you type the following command, OpenSSL will ask you to fill the info above and it will generate the CSR:

openssl req -new -key "C:\Temp\key.pem" -out "C:\Temp\ffastrans_webinterface_csr.txt"

You're all done, grab the code signing request .txt file from C:\Temp and send it to the CA along with the URL of the webinterface.
They'll review it and decide whether they'll grant you the certificate or not.
If everything checks out, you'll get a new shiny cert.pem which you'll be able to put in the cert folder of the webinterface 
by replacing the example one and you can do the same with the key.pem that you find in C:\Temp.
After that you can easily go settings, fill the password field with the password you picked during the creation of the key.pem
and enable the HTTPS mode.
